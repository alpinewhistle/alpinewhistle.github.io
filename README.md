Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Stephanie, a project manager from South Carolina working and living in Atlanta.

After graduating with a BS in biology, I started my career like lots of others: searching desperately for an opening remotely related to my degree. Fortunately for future me, that didnâ€™t pan out.

I started in a role in the marketing department of a [private school](https://www.heathwood.org/) in my hometown. There, I was pushed to explore the worlds of brand-building, communications strategy, and most importantly, project management, where my natural tendencies to plan and organize found a home.

Iâ€™ve since had the opportunity to work on in-house and client projects, from print magazines and digital campaigns to websites and mobile apps. Iâ€™ve played the roles of strategist, realist, devilâ€™s advocate, and cheerleader, along with quite a few others that come with being a project manager. There are a lot of things to love about this job, but the best part is seeing the amazing things my team can accomplish when we work together to get stuff done. :)

If youâ€™d like to get to know me a little better, you can [download my resume here](https://www.dropbox.com) or [send me an email](mailto:stephewill@gmail.com).
