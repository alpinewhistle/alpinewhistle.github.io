Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Stephanie, a project manager from South Carolina working and living in the great city of Atlanta.

After graduating with a BS in biology, I started my career like many other 20-somethings: searching desperately for an opening remotely related to my degree. Fortunately for me, that didnâ€™t happen.

I started a job in the marketing department of a [private school](https://www.heathwood.org/) in my hometown. There, I was pushed to explore the worlds of brand-building, communications strategy, and most importantly, project management, where my natural tendencies to plan and organize found a home.

Iâ€™ve since had the opportunity to work on in-house and client projects, from print magazines and digital campaigns to websites and mobile apps. Iâ€™ve played the roles of strategist, realist, devilâ€™s advocate, and cheerleader, along with several others that come with being a project manager. There are so many things to love about this job, and while I do get some satisfaction from checking things off a list, the best part is seeing the amazing things my team can accomplish when we work together to get stuff done.

If youâ€™d like to know a little more about me, you can [download my resume](https://www.dropbox.com) or [send me an email](mailto:stephewill@gmail.com). My inbox is always open. :)
